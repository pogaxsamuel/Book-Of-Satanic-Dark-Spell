<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>You are about to enter a world of unbelievable power. The staggering potential possible
to you through the use of the information to be found within this book is not to be taken
lightly. To do so would be more than foolhardy, it would be dangerous in ways some
people can barely understand.</p>
<p>Understand that this is not some parlor game. The magicks contained here are not
something for bored teenagers to play with when their Ouija boards and Tarot cards no
longer amuse. This is a guide to power unimaginable. Take a moment to understand those
words.</p>
<p>Power.</p>
<p>Unimaginable.</p>
<p>The drawings you now possess are signposts to all worldly desires. They are the basis for
a system of sorcery which both created and destroyed the greatest empires of the ancient
world. The drawings contained within this volume date back to 3,000 B.C. They are
amongst the oldest written human records, cursed and praised things the exact origin of
which nobody knows.</p>
<p>All that is known is as follows: they were created, used and maintained down through the
millennia by the Yoruba Africans. The deities in them are used to invoke the power of the
ancient, but still active Yoruban deities. The proper term for these gods is "orishas,"
which translates as "force of light (or power)." The orishas do not correlate to any of the
belief systems which followed them. In some aspects they resemble the Egyptian, Greek
and Roman gods, in some, the Catholic saints and even the ideas behind the cabalistic
Tree of Life. It is a religion which predates all others, and from which these others may
have freely borrowed over the centuries.</p>
<p>Understand that the drawing spells you are about to work with are as simple and effective
as they were at the dawn of human recorded history. They predate books, scrolls and
even alphabets. Their simplicity makes them deceptively dangerous. Do not</p>
<hr>
<p>be fooled by the ease involved here. The ancients worked on belief. If you believe-truly
believe-these drawings will give you power without limit. If you don't think you can
handle something, it is certain you can't. Be careful. Be certain. Do nothing out of
frivolity. The price of arrogance is destruction.</p>
<p>Always.</p>
<p>The symbolic drawings, or signatures as they are called in their native lands, represent the
powers of nature. More exactly, they are the Orishas, the spirit forces that manipulate the
powers of nature to their own ends. On their own they can sometimes be malicious.
Sometimes they will be helpful. They are willful, powerful entities, and must be treated
with the proper respect.</p>
<p>The powers of the Orishas overlap only in the smallest details. They are jealous spirits
and must be invoked carefully. Some are more powerful than others. Some can influence
only certain segments of nature, some can influence them all. One must not concern
themselves overly with who the Orisha are, or try to know them in any kind of personal
sense.</p>
<p>These forces are known by the following names. But remember, these names are given
for you that you might show the proper respect, not try to give orders. These forces are
like unto gods. If they notice you and accept your request, it is because you have pleased
or amused them. Never think that you are a master giving commands.
OBATALA: Keeper of the peace. A provider of health. Reservoir of all that is pure.
ELLEGUA: Opener of opportunities. Messenger of all the other Orishas. A dangerous
spirit, it is the closest of the Orishas to what the Western mind would call
the Devil.</p>
<p>YEMAYA: Mother of all. The main provider of health, but also of protection. The
healer that uses pure love as a shield. Strongly connected with the seas.</p>
<p>CHANGO: Bestower of virility. Keeper of honor. The righteous defender that uses
fire and lightning as its terrible weapons.</p>
<p>OSHUN: Guardian of seduction. Lover of money. That which watches over
marriage and all the ¡oys of life.</p>
<p>OGGUN: Lord of the attack. The killer. Patron of all laborers as well as the
blacksmith of the Orishas.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now, try to remember, as the wise old saying goes, "familiarity breeds contempt." Keep
your distance from these forces. Draw your signatures as instructed. Do as the
instructions say. Do not deviate from the formulas as given. Do not try to understand the
beings upon whom you are calling. They are all-powerful. They are unknowable. Call on
them for favors, and plead your case carefully.</p>
<p>Do not make demands. Be wise in your asking. Remember, greed, like the love of
comfort, is a kind of fear. All of nature abhors fear, and instinctively will attack it. Do not
make your callings out of fear or anger. Calm your heart. Ask for what you truly desire. If
</p><p>you allow your passions to control your askings, they you will ask for too much.</p>
When this happens, you will no longer be controlled by your passions. You will be the
toy of the Orishas. Remember the old saying, "be careful what you wish for, you ¡ust
might get it."<p></p>

    <td>NOTE:</td>
    <td><p>Almost all of the drawings revealed here must be made on either a wooden
    surface or a piece of paper. There is a single instance where red cloth can
    be used (and wood is still preferred). Either should be as unprocessed as
    possible. The less ink, varnish, paint, chemicals, et cetera, that make up
    your magical canvas, the more effective your spell will be.</p></td>

    <td>ALSO:</td>
    <td><p>ALL of your drawings should be made with either chalk, crayon or pencil.
    The only colors used should be white or green. Note that when the word
    "chalk" is used in a ritual, what is really being called for is crushed egg
    shell. All signatures that call for chalk should really be made with the
    powder of crushed egg shells. Since this is an ingredient that is very hard
    for most Westerners to obtain (or even to make for themselves), chalk can
    be substituted here. The casting will not be as effective, and the ritual will
    have to be invoked for a longer period of time, but it will eventually work.</p></td>

    <td><p>Once any ritual has been completed, before your canvas can be used again,
    it must be washed clean with rum. ONLY rum will do. Note: Whenever
    rum is called for in a signature, it must only be used for cleaning. If no
    cleaning is required, it must be sacrificed. DO NOT DRINK the rum used
    in any ritual.</p></td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<hr>
ALSO: Remember that any rum, cigars, honey or anything else used in a
ritual must be of the finest quality. Do not think of insulting the gods with
anything but the best.
<p>Also, remember that this is a ¡udgment call-if, for instance, you honestly
believe that you have acquired the best cigar in town, even if there is a
much better cigar available right next door, the gods invoked will know
your intentions. As long as you honestly believe you have done your best,
they will be satisfied.</p>
<table cellspacing"100"="">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td>ALSO:</td>
    <td><p>Some rituals will call for the use of an "Elegua." This is a special magical
    tool which takes literally decades of preparation. It is unknown in the
    West and, due to some of its ingredients, can not even be imported into
    Western countries.
    However, a personal stone can be used in its place. Not a piece of concrete
    or a brick, a stone. Pick one as your own. Clean it in rum and keep it for
    all your rituals. It will not generate the power of an Ogun, but it will
    function in its place.</p></td>

  <li><h3><strong>PROTECTION FROM ENEMIES</strong></h3></li>
  <p>This is the signature of the three warriors. It is used for personal protection against illness
and enemies.</p>
  <p>After completing your drawing, light three white candles at the top of the upper arrows as
shown in the diagram. Next, light one red candle which should be positioned over the
"X" formed by the two diagonal arrows.</p>
<p>1.</p>

<p>2.</p>
<hr>
  <li><h3><strong>ESCAPE AND FREEDOM</strong></h3></li>
  <p>This is Ochosi. This drawing is to be used to gift prisoners with freedom. It can be used
in simple cases such as freeing people from jail, or in more complicated situations such as
releasing people (or oneself) from destructive relationships or even addictions.</p>
  <p>The name or names of those for whom you desire freedom are to be written in front of the
two sheathed arrows (the arrows actually within their bows). Red and white candles must
be placed as shown in the diagram.</p>
<p>3.</p>
<hr>

<p>4.</p>
<hr>
  <li><h3><strong>GOOD HEALTH</strong></h3></li>
  <p>This is one of the most powerfoi invocations to be found within this belief system. lt must
be drawn in white on wood-ONLY. It would be best to make the drawing with egg shells.
If egg shells are not used, only white chalk can be substituted.</p>
  <p>This spell is used in the pursuit of both great wealth and good health. Two white, one
green, and one black candle are needed. Light and position them as shown. Write your
name about the central arrow as shown.</p>
<p>5.</p>
<hr>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Seal_of_Baphomet.svg/640px-Seal_of_Baphomet.svg.png" alt="">
<p>6.</p>
<hr>
  <li><h3><strong>PEACE, JOY AND HARMONY</strong></h3></li>
<p>This is one of the simpler rituals. It invokes kind and gentle powers, entreating them to
bring you the good things in life.</p>
<p>Once drawn (on either paper or wood), it should be hidden beneath a rug, or better yet,
the floor, for best results. This ritual should not be washed away as its effect for you will
only be felt as long as it remains cleanly drawn and hidden from sight.</p>
<p>7.</p>
<hr>
<img src="https://image.spreadshirtmedia.net/image-server/v1/mp/products/T1459A839PA4459PT28D182229637W9997H10000/views/1,width=1200,height=630,appearanceId=839,backgroundColor=F2F2F2/astaroth-sticker.jpg" alt="">
<p>8.</p>
<hr>
  <li><h3><strong>THE DOMINATOR</strong></h3></li>
<p>This ritual drawing invokes the power of the "Dominator" or "Controller." It is an allpurpose spell, one to be used to control, or dominate, friends, lovers or enemies. The
nature of your relationships is unimportant to the powers being called upon here.</p>
<p>Three red candles are to be placed on the three central "Xs" located between the vertical
arrows (see diagram). The name of the person you wish to control is to be written in
chalk or pencil above the candles as shown in the diagram. Better still to be used here is a
personal item of the person to be dominated.</p>
<p>This ritual is for the calling of good fortune. It summons unto the user a combination of
all available powers. It will make all good things in your life better than they are. It will
not, however, eliminate bad influences.</p>

<p>10.</p>
<hr>
<li><h3><strong>WHEEL OF LUCK AND FORTUNE</strong></h3></li>
<p>This ritual must be drawn on wood. To be effective it must be written in white chalk.
Your signature must go at the point of the solitary arrow (see diagram). A white candle
must be lit and placed at the apex where the serpent and the snake cross (see diagram).</p>
<p>11.</p>
<hr>
<img src="./The Santanic Dark Spell_files/1000_F_116747136_Xki5zgiWlpCYuxEUaF0d8bnOB5TgB8vZ (2).jpg" alt="">
<p>12.</p>
<hr>
<li><h3><strong>GOOD LUCK AND GOOD FORTUNE</strong></h3></li>
<p>This ritual also evokes all available powers. It is to be used for wish fulfillment.</p>
<p>It should only be drawn on wood and only with white chalk. Your signature should be
placed at the top of the central arrow as shown in the diagram. Your desires should be
written at the point of the diagonal arrow as shown. Understand that while there is no
limit to the amount of wishes you can make at one time with this spell, the more wishes
made at one time, the more watered down the ritual will become.</p>
<p>After completion, this drawing should be left within your main personal dwelling place.
It is vitally important that the central arrow point be aimed facing toward a doorway,
especially one that leads to the outside. Also: duplicating the spell on a piece of paper and
keeping it with you at all times will greatly enhance its power.</p>
<p>13.</p>
<hr>
<img src="./The Santanic Dark Spell_files/HFpFBZz.jpg" alt="">
<p>14.</p>
<hr>
<li><h3><strong>GREAT FREEDOM</strong></h3></li>
<p>This signature is for obtaining freedom, whether it be for someone else or for one's self.
If that freedom is sought from prison, from a marriage, or any other type of physical or
spiritual imprisonment, this is the ritual which must be invoked.</p>
<p>This drawing should be made on wood with white chalk. The name of the person to be
freed should be written above the arrow tips as shown. The name of that which is
imprisoning the prisoner should be written below the base of the shafts as shown. A white
candle must be burned at the exact center of the drawing as shown.</p>
<p>ALSO: A small glass with honey in it should be placed near the white candle. The exact
position is not important. The honey should be tasted before the glass is positioned, but
after the candle has been lit.</p>
<p>15.</p>
<hr>
<img src="./The Santanic Dark Spell_files/HFpFBZz(1).jpg" alt="">
<p>16.</p>
<hr>
<li><h3><strong>ALL PURPOSE</strong></h3></li>
<p>This signature is to be drawn on a red surface (either paper or wood) with white chalk.
The name of the person to be affected is to be written at the tip of the vertical arrow. An
Ogun must be placed over their name. A white candle and a yellow candle must both be
burned. Place as shown.</p>
<p>This ritual is for the ensuring of continued health. It is not a healer. It may also be used
for minor wishes.</p>
<p>17.</p>
<hr>
<img src="./The Santanic Dark Spell_files/HFpFBZz(2).jpg" alt="">
<p>18.</p>
<hr>
<li><h3><strong>GREAT POWER</strong></h3></li>
<p>This ritual is for the generating of wishes. It can be drawn on either paper or wood. Any
of the writing materials may be used.</p>
<p>The name of the person whom the wishes will affect is to be written at the tip of the
single vertical arrow. The wishes are to be written at the tips of the three arrows running
diagonally to the right, and then again at the tips of the three arrows running diagonally to
the left.</p>
<p>All three wishes must center around the person who is named.</p>
<p>When finished, this ritual can be hidden anywhere. It is, however, highly effective when
drawn on the front door of one's dwelling</p>
<p>19.</p>
<hr>
<img src="./The Santanic Dark Spell_files/HFpFBZz(3).jpg" alt="">
<p>20.</p>
<hr>
<li><h3><strong>GOOD LUCK ALL AROUND YOU</strong></h3></li>
<p>This signature invokes the powers of Elegua. It is used to attract general good fortune to
one's self, home and family. One most have a specific idea of the fortune one is looking
for (i.e., general good health for the family, luck in business for one's self, happiness for a
daughter, et cetera). This ritual only ensures general good fortune; it will not respond to
specific requests.</p>
<p>Note that the lines creating the snakes must be OPEN. This is not a single thick line, but
two thin lines creating a form.</p>
<p>21.</p>
<hr>
<li><h3><strong>THE LADDER OF POWER</strong></h3></li>
<p>This signature is for climbing the ladder of success. This means more than just reaching
for success in the world of commerce. It is equally effective in any human endeavor
where perseverance is needed, i.e., the world of sports, the arena of romance, et cetera. It
is to be used to give a general boost to any segment of your life, rising it up to what is
generally known as "the good life."</p>
<p>The paper is then to be carried with you at all times. It need not be on your person, it can
be in a pocketbook or brief case, et cetera. But, it must be nearby. Also: you may not
draw one for home, one for the car, one for the office, and so on. You can draw only one
(at a time) and that one must be kept with you.</p>
<p>22.</p>
<hr>
<li><h3><strong>GOOD FORTUNE</strong></h3></li>
<p>This signature calls upon the powers of Oshun. It is to be used to bring to oneself good
fortune. This is not great, multi-millionaire kinds of fortune. This is a more modest ritual,
used for bringing a condition more akin to "comfort." It can be used for creating this
condition within any aspect of life.</p>
<p>1. Under a rug</p>
<p>2. Under a mattress</p>
<p>3. At the bottom of a drawer</p>
<p>23.</p>
<hr>
<li><h3><strong>GREATEST POWER</strong></h3></li>
<p>This signature calls upon Ellegua, the Devil. This is a very powerful ritual and must be
done with extreme caution. It beseeches Ellegua to override Ochosi and effect the release
of a person from prison.</p>
<p>24.</p>
<hr>
<li><h3><strong>ROMANCE FOR LONG TERM</strong></h3></li>
<h3><strong>RELATIONSHIP OR MARRIAGE</strong></h3>
<p>This signature is for finding the right person for you. Ms. Right, Prince Charming,
whatever. It can be used in either or two ways: to help make a choice between two or
more potential lovers, or to simply help bring an unknown, but perfect mate to you.</p>
<p>Note: this is a more difficult drawing than many of the others, and it often does not work
the first time. Patience can be required with this signature</p>
<p>25.</p>
<hr>
<li><h3><strong>FOR HEALTH AND STRENGTH</strong></h3></li>
<p>Yemaya is in charge of pleas coming from the use of this ritual. It is a signature for the
invocation of good health. Note that this is not for sustaining current good health, but for
the displacement of illness. Note also that it is to be used for ANY illness from the
common cold to cancer, as well as in those cases where one simply "isn't feeling right." It
is also to be used in the case of mental as well as physical illnesses.</p>
<p>26.</p>
<hr>
<li><h3><strong>FOR BUSINESS WHEN THERE IS A</strong></h3></li>
<h3><strong>DRY PERIOD</strong></h3>
<p>This signature calls on all of the Orishas except, fortunately, for Ellegua. It is to be used
for increasing or expanding a business venture. It works only on ventures already
established. It is NOT for the creation of a new venture.</p>
<p>Your name should be placed at the tips of both of the diagonal arrows. Your wishes (i.e.,
how you wish your business to be expanded) should be written at both ends of the three
horizontal arrows. Again, see the diagram for the proper positioning.</p>
<p>27.</p>
<hr>
<li><h3><strong>INVOKE POWER FOR FREEDOM</strong></h3></li>
<p>This signature calls on Ellegua, which means one must be precise and careful in all
motions. It is used to bring blessings on one who is in trouble with the authorities. While
it can be used to obtain someone's release from prison, it is a more "all purpose" casting.
This should be used to aid those (or oneself, if necessary) being hunted by the law, facing
a trial, awaiting sentencing, et cetera.</p>
<p>Your name must be written at the tip of the upward extending, left-leaning diagonal
arrow. Your name must also be written at the tip of the central, vertical arrow. An Ogun
must cover your name wherever it appears in the signature. See the diagram for all
positionings.</p>
<p>Also: after the ritual has been completed, the chalk (or egg shell powder) used must be
scraped together and taken to a place of authority which symbolizes the trouble you seek
to avoid. If, for instance, one is seeking to avoid capture by the police, the chalk must be
taken to a police station. Then, in front of the building, you must take a pinch of the
powder in your fingers, bring it close to your lips, then blow it away.s</p>
<p>28.</p>
<hr>
<li><h3><strong>POWERFUL DESTROYER OF</strong></h3></li>
<h3><strong>ENEMIES</strong></h3>
<p>Here is a simple signature. It is used for removing jinxes, negative influences, or any
other obstacles you perceive as being in your path.</p>
<p>No candles or stones, et cetera, are needed here. Simply draw it on a piece of paper in any
medium. It will remove all evil or negative influences from your life. Keep it in your
pocket, hide it anywhere.</p>
<p>Once created it will work for life, although it is advised that one should recreate this
signature at a regular interval merely to show gratitude to the gods. One does not want
the Orishas to think they are being taken for granted.</p>
<p>29.</p>
<hr>
<li><h3><strong>EXTREME GOOD HEALTH</strong></h3></li>
<p>This signature is to be used to help the extremely ill. In those cases where the patient is
hospitalized, it may be impossible to use due to the extent of the candle burning which
must be done.</p>
<p>30.</p>
